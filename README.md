## Editing

### VSCode Extensions
Install the following extensions in vscode for autocompletion:
- [clangd](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd)
- [python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

The settings should be picked up from `.vscode/settings.json`
There should be a popup in Vscode to install the same extensions

### Package Validator
To validate that you haven't done any mistakes in a ROS package, you can run the following 
```
uv run util/validator/validate_package.py ./src/<PACKAGE NAME>
```

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you aren't in a python virtual env already (conda), if you encounter python packages missing its usually because the uv venv isnt sourced or you are using conda

### Sourcing
```
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source .venv/bin/activate
source install/setup.bash
```

### Building
```
make build
```
or 
```
colcon build
```

If you encounter issues when building, make sure you have _sourced_ ROS2, By doing:
```
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
```
